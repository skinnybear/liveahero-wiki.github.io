A human originated from Sapporo, Japan, his real name is Kensuke Kitakami.
Despite reaching the top of his profession and become the world champion, that doesn't fulfil his ambition. Therefore he start the journey to the wider galaxy in hopes of fighting more ferocious competitor.
Due to overly aggressive thinking and hyperactivity, his behaviour are very blunt and stubborn.
A man who is both a hero and a troublemaker, can often be found in the midst of a big riot.
